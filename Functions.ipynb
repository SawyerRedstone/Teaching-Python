    "A **function** is a reuseable chunk of code designed to do a specific job. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've already used two functions before: `print()` and `input()`. Using a function is called **calling** it. When a function is called, Python searches for where the function was defined and then runs the code inside the function definition. The print() and input() functions are defined already, so we don't need to worry about creating them ourselves. Often, however, we need to define our own functions. Here is how to define a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def your_function_name():\n",
    "    # Here is where you type the code for the specific job you want your function to do.\n",
    "    # Make sure your code is indented, just like these comments are.\n",
    "    # The indented code here within the function is called the \"function body\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's break down what everything here means.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) `def` is short for \"define\", and it tells Python that you are about to define a new function.\n",
    "2) After `def`, we must tell Python the name of the function we are defining. Here the name was `your_function_name`, but you can replace this with whatever name makes most sense for your function. Since functions are supposed to do a specific job, a good name would describe what your function does. For example, a function to do math could be named `do_math` or `calculate`.\n",
    "3) Add parentheses `()` after the function name! Function names should always have parentheses after them. This tells our code that we are working with a function, not a variable.\n",
    "4) Add a colon (`:`) to specify you're about to write a block of code. Code blocks are lines of indented code that are all grouped together.\n",
    "5) The block of code after the colon is called the **function body**. There can be several lines of code here, and each one must be indented to show that it belongs to the function. These lines of code only run when the function is called. The function body contains all the code you want your function to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- A function is like a set of steps to solve a puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colons aren't only for functions; they appear wherever a bunch of code belongs to the line above.\n",
    " -->"
