    "Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. Everything in Python (apart from keywords like `if` and `def`) is an object. If you type the number 5, the text \"hello\", or define a functions, all of those are creating an object. So what is an object?\n",

    "Sometimes you'll want to reference the same object multiple times in your code. For this you need a **variable**. \n",
    "\n",
    "A variable points to an object's location in memory so that the computer can locate that data and use it at a later time. But that all happens behind the scenes; as a coder, you don't need to know the actual location in your computer's memory where the object is stored. Creating a variable is as simple as giving a name to an object. If your code needs to store someone's age, the object will be their age (say, 13), and you can make a variable store that information by typing this line of code: `age = 13`.\n",
    "\n",
    "That line creates the object 13 in the computer's memory and then creates a variables named `age` which points to that 13 in memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "The variable didn't have to be named `age`. If we wanted to specify that this is Bob's age (and not John or Stacy's age), we could have written the line as `bob_age = 13`. You as a coder can decide the best name for your variable. It should be a name that makes it clear what information the variable points to, since otherwise you (and anyone else working with your code) can easily get confused and not remember which variables store what information. When you create a variable, you must assign the variable an object to point at.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are certain rules for naming variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A variable must start with a letter or underscore (`_`).\n",
    "2) A variable name can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`). They cannot contain spaces or other symbols.\n",
    "3) A variable cannot share a name with any built-in keywords in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: when naming a variable that contains multiple words, it is recommended to name them using **snake_case** (also known as \"lower_case_with_underscores\"). snake_case is a style of naming variables where all words are lowercase and all spaces are replaced by underscores. For example, if you wanted a variable storing delicious foods, you'd name it `delicious_foods`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's generally recommended to name variables using snake_case, there is one notable exception: when working with a company, it is best to stay consistant with whatever style they use. For example, if they prefer to name variables using camelCase (first letter lowercase, then all future words beginning in a capital letter), you should copy their style and name your variable `deliciousFoods` instead.\n",
